PageRank
Most people have already forgotten how dark and unsignposted the Internet once was. A user in 1996, when the Web comprised hundreds of thousands of “sites” with millions of “pages,” did not expect to be able to search for “Olympics” and automatically find the official site of the Atlanta games. That was too hard a problem. 

But in 1996 as part of a research project about a new kind of search engine, PageRank was developed at Stanford University by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The PageRank is a search ranking algorithm using hyperlinks on the Web. Based on the algorithm, they built the search engine Google, which has been a huge success. The main algorithm can be described as follows:

 1. A hyperlink from a page pointing to another page is an implicit conveyance of authority
to the target page. Thus, the more in-links that a page i receives, the more prestige the
page i has.
 3. Pages that point to page i also have their own prestige scores. A page with a higher
prestige score pointing to i is more important than a page with a lower prestige score
pointing to i. In other words, a page is important if it is pointed to by other important
pages.

The application of Google PageRank gets us Google Search Engine and helps to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. In a big way, it helps Globalization:

> By 2010, 22 percent of the world's population had access to computers with 1 billion Google searches every day.(wikipedia: Globalization)

My presentation focuses on the understanding of the algorithm(scrape the surface). My presentation is [here](http://www.slideshare.net/liyifancolumbia/google-page-rank-33763088)
