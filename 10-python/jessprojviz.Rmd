Project Viz
========================================================
First I need to load the data
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
PositionData <- read.csv("/Applications/R/PositionData.csv")
skill <- read.csv("/Applications/R/skill.csv")
orgtype <- read.csv("/Applications/R/orgtype.csv")
```

Here are three project vizualizations:

This data, comes from the toplines of a political data survey that went around on some internal list-serves.

1. Type of Position by Average Salary

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = PositionData) + aes(x = Position, y = Average) + geom_histogram()
```

2. Skill by Average Salary 

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = skill) + aes(x = Skill, y = Average) + geom_boxplot()
```

3. Org Type by Average Salary

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
ggplot(data = orgtype) + aes(x = Type, y = Average) + geom_point()
```
