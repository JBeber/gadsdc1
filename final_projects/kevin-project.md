Here is a link to my [private repo](https://github.com/justmarkham/kaggle-allstate) that Aaron and Tom can access, with the first draft of my final paper.

The [Kaggle rules](http://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-purchase-prediction-challenge/rules) say that you can't share "code or data" unless you post it on the Kaggle forum, which I don't want to do. To make sure I'm in compliance, I'm going to keep my repo private until the competition ends.
